- defining the config of MPU from program
- allocate of stack using possibly all inused memory
- script for compiling allows using makefile
- parallel pic and pc compiling to simplify testing during development
- script for generating include files from gputils include files
- includes for more MPUs
- pre-compiling includes and libraries to speed up the compilation
- documentation
- possibility of compiling in bytestream (see the bytestream study)
- libraries for periferials
- optimize the generated program to avoid unneccessary push-pop
- think about 8bit and 16bit values on stack. It is hard to write program mixing
  8bit and 16bit values.
- 8bit literals ( in this moment you must use construction like [ 123 ]l8  
- more soffisticated macro 'mypageselw' to optimize code for MPUs with 0 or 1 program page
  ( for 0 pages ignore the macro, for 1 page using bsf instruction )
- libraries for MPUs with enhanced instruction set
- scripts per Windows and Mac

and many many more features
