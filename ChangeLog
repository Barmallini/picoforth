- 'create' and 'constant' for PIC

-  simple words like variable!, variable-inc etc are defined only in pc forth vocabularies as strings,
   no more as macro in asm file. This saves more than 90% of size of asm file.
   
-  optimizer eliminates byte>word word>byte sequences ( literal 16 -> store to 8 bit variable etc )

-  optimizer makes warnings about literal out of range

-  words like variable-inc, variable+! variable-and! etc 
   are automatically defined when variable or fsr is defined
