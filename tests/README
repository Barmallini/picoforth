programs in this directory are test of (possibly) all words defined in libraries 
including program construction words like 'if' and 'while'

All tests was ran on simulator, port A is used to display result of test.
If some test fails, the number of test si flashing on port A.
If all tests of given program was passed, the 0xff is displayed.

words cs (check stack) and cs8 that are used in test programs tests the stack for 
given values and if founds that stack does not contains the expected values,
the error number is flashing on port A. If the port A does not flashing and does not
displaing 0xff, the test is blocked in point after the displayed number.

example of using word cs:
1 2 + 4 swap   cs 4 3  $ab

if the stack does not contains 4 and 3 (result of the operation before), the flashing $ab is displayed
otherwise the program goes to the next test
